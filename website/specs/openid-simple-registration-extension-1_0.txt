                OpenID Simple Registration Extension 1.0


Abstract

   OpenID Simple Registation is an extension to the OpenID
   Authentication protocol that allows for very light-weight profile
   exchange.  It is designed to pass eight commonly requested pieces of
   information when an End User goes to register a new account with a
   web service.

1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   End User: The actual human user who wants to prove their Identity to
      a Consumer.

   Consumer: A web service that wants proof that the End User owns the
      Claimed Identity.

   Identity Provider: Also called "IdP" or "Server".  This is the OpenID
      Authentication server that a Consumer contacts for cryptographic
      proof that the End User owns the Claimed Identity.

3.  Request Format

   The request parameters detailed here SHOULD be sent with OpenID
   Authentication checkid_immediate or checkid_setup requests.

   All of the following request fields are OPTIONAL, though at least one
   of "openid.sreg.required" or "openid.sreg.optional" MUST be specified
   in the request.

   openid.sreg.required: Comma-separated list of field names which, if
      absent from the response, will prevent the Consumer from
      completing the registration without End User interation.  The
      field names are those that are specified in the Response Format
      (Section 4), with the "openid.sreg." prefix removed.

   openid.sreg.optional: Comma-separated list of field names Fields that
      will be used by the Consumer, but whose absence will not prevent
      the registration from completing.  The field names are those that
      are specified in the Response Format (Section 4), with the
      "openid.sreg." prefix removed.

   openid.sreg.policy_url: A URL which the Consumer provides to give the
      End User a place to read about the how the profile data will be
      used.  The Identity Provider SHOULD display this URL to the End
      User if it is given.

4.  Response Format

   The fields below SHOULD be included in the Identity Providers's
   response when "openid.mode" is "id_res".

   The response's "openid.signed" field list MUST include the returned
   registration field names, prefixed without the openid. prefix (e.g.,
   sreg.nickname).  The "openid.sig" field MUST provide a signature for
   the sreg. fields in addition to the OpenID data according to the
   OpenID Authentication specification.

   If the Consumer's signature verification fails, then no registration
   data from the Identity Provider SHOULD be used.

   The Consumer MUST be prepared to handle a response which lacks fields
   marked as required or optional.

   The behavior in the case of missing required fields or extra,
   unrequested fields is up to the Consumer.  The Consumer SHOULD treat
   this situation the same as it would if the End User entered the data
   manually.

   A single field MUST NOT be repeated in the response, and all included
   fields MUST be taken from the set of fields defined in this
   specification.

   An Identity Provider MAY return any subset of the following fields in
   response to the query.  In particular:

   openid.sreg.nickname: Any UTF-8 string that the End User wants to use
      as a nickname.

   openid.sreg.email: The email address of the End User as specified in
      section 3.4.1 of [RFC2822].

   openid.sreg.fullname: UTF-8 string free text representation of the
      End User's full name.

   openid.sreg.dob: The End User's date of birth as YYYY-MM-DD.  Any
      values whose representation uses fewer than the specified number
      of digits should be zero-padded.  The length of this value MUST
      always be 10.  If the End User user does not want to reveal any
      particular component of this value, it MUST be set to zero.

      For instance, if a End User wants to specify that his date of
      birth is in 1980, but not the month or day, the value returned
      SHALL be "1980-00-00".

   openid.sreg.gender: The End User's gender, "M" for male, "F" for
      female.

   openid.sreg.postcode: UTF-8 string free text that SHOULD conform to
      the End User's country's postal system.

   openid.sreg.country: The End User's country of residence as specified
      by ISO3166 [1].

   openid.sreg.language: End User's preferred language as specified by
      ISO639 [2].

   openid.sreg.timezone: ASCII string from TimeZone database [3]

      For example, "Europe/Paris" or "America/Los_Angeles".
