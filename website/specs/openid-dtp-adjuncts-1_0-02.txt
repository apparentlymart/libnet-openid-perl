Abstract

   OpenID DTP is a protocol for sending, receiving, and relaying an
   arbitrary signed and encrypted payload between two endpoints.  DTP
   Version 1.0 Part 2: Adjuncts defines a set of adjuncts that may be
   used with DTP Version 1.0 Part 1: Envelopes.  This specification
   depends on the messages described in Part 1.

2.  Discovery

   User public keys and Reciever Endpoint URLs are discovered using
   Yadis or XRI Resolution.  If the Identifier is a URL, the Yadis
   protocol MUST be attempted on that URL.  The Yadis protocol and XRI
   resolution both yield an XRDS document.  This is a simple XML
   document with entries for services that are related to the
   Identifier.  Each "<xrd:Service>" element in the XRD that provides
   messaging will contain the following information:

      An "<xrd:Type>" element whose inner text is
      "http://www.example.com/2006/06/dtp#"

      An "<xrd:URI>" tag whose text content is the Reciever Endpoint URL

      A "<PublicKey>" element whose text content is the URL of the
      Public Key for that Reciever Endpoint URL.

   Once the appropriate Service has been discovered, the Public Key for
   that Reciever Endpoint URL can be retrieved by performing an HTTP GET
   using URL contained in the "<PublicKey>" element.

   Currently only one form of public key is defined.  The HTTP response
   should be a PEM formatted RSA Public Key and have a Content-Type of
   "application/pem".

3.  Extension Algorithms

   If a Reciever Endpoint supports alternative cryptographic algorithms,
   they can be advertised in the "<xrd:Service>" element of the XRDS
   document containing the Reciever Endpoint URL by adding an additional
   "<xrd:Type>" element containing the algorithm identifier.

   When a sender parses the XRDS document during discovery (Section 2),
   they can then look for advertised extension algorithms that they know
   about.  It is up to the sender what algorithm is used.  Advertising
   extenstion algorithms is purely advisory, and senders are in no way
   obligated to use them.  It is an error to use an extension algorithm
   that is not advertised.

4.  HTTP(S) Binding

   This section describes a mechanism for sending and recieving messages
   using the Hypertext Transport Protocol 1.1 [HTTP].  If a Reciever
   Endpoint URL has an HTTPS scheme, it may be reasonable to use the
   NULL encryption type, depending on the application.

4.1.  HTTP Request

   A request to send a message to a Reciever Endpoint URL is an HTTP
   request with the Method set to POST.  The body the request is the
   Outer Envelope XML document.  The Content-Type header of the request
   should be set to "application/dtp+xml".

   The Reciever Endpoint should verify the message according to the
   rules described in the Message Validation section of [DTP-1] as well
   as any application-specific verification that is necessary before
   returning a response.

4.2.  HTTP Response

   The HTTP Response Entity will either be emtpy, denoted by a Content-
   Length Header of 0, or an Outer Envelope XML Document.  If the
   response entity exists, it should be accompanied by a Content-Type
   header of "application/dtp+xml".

   It is up to the application whether a response entity is appropriate.
   A response entity is only appropriate with an HTTP Status Code of
   200.

   HTTP Status Codes should be interpreted as follows:

   200 The message was delivered successfully; no further action is
      required of the client.

   400 Processing the message resulted in an error code.  The HTTP
      Response Entity will contain the signed error message, including
      the error code and the digest of the bytes recieved.

   500 Indicates an internal error while the recieving server was
      processing the request.  The Sender MAY retry delivery.

   Any response with a Status Code not listed above is considered a
   permanent failure to deliver.
