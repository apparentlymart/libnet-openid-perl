1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.  Definitions and Conventions

   [NOTE: Update terminology based on final OpenID 2.0 draft.]

   User: (Or "End User".)  A person with a digital identity who
      participates in OpenID based identity information exchanges using
      their client software, typically a web browser.

   Identity Data: A property of a digital identity in which the Property
      Name and Property Value are represented as a name-value pair.

   Persona: A user can have multiple personas as part of their identity.
      For example, a user might have a work persona and a home persona.
      A persona is a subset of the user's identity data.

   Identity Provider: Also called "IdP" or "Server".  This is the OpenID
      Authentication server that a Consumer contacts for cryptographic
      proof that the End User owns the Claimed Identity.

   Consumer: A site that requests identity data from an Identity
      Provider via the user's client.

   For the purposes of this document, the extension namespace identifier
   for the attribute exchange service will be "ax".

2.  Overview

   The attribute exchange service is identified by the URI
   "http://openid.net/srv/ax/1.0" [NOTE: subject to change in following
   drafts].

   An attribute is a unit of personal identity information that is
   identified by a unique URI.  It may refer to any kind of information;
   see [Prop_List] for some examples.

   This service defines two additional message types for transferring
   attributes: fetch (see Section 4) and store (see Section 5).  Fetch
   retrieves attribute information from an Identity Provider, while
   store saves or updates attribute information on the Identity
   Provider.  Both messages originate from the Consumer site or service
   provider and are passed to the Identity Provider via the user agent
   as per the OpenID protocol specification.

   The request parameters detailed here SHOULD be sent with OpenID
   Authentication checkid_immediate or checkid_setup requests.  [NOTE:
   This portion of the spec will change depending on the final draft of
   OpenID 2.0.]

   Error responses are communicated using the standard OpenID methods;
   see [OpenID_Auth].

3.  Discovery

   Discovery of the attribute exchange service is achieved via the
   mechanism described in [OpenID_Auth].  The attribute exchange
   namespace "http://openid.net/srv/ax/1.0" SHOULD be listed as an <xrd:
   Type> child element of the <xrd:Service> element in the XRDS
   discovery document.

4.  Fetch Message

   The fetch message is used to retrieve personal identity attributes
   from an Identity Provider.

4.1.  Fetch Request Format

   All of the following request fields are OPTIONAL, though at least one
   of "openid.ax.required" or "openid.ax.if_available" MUST be specified
   in the request.  Separate "required" or "if_available" directives
   must be used for each identifier name referred to.  Any identifier
   name referred to in a "required" or "if_available" parameter MUST
   have an associated "openid.ax.fetch.<identifier name>" parameter.

   openid.ax.fetch.<identifier name> Associates an identifier name with
      the attribute URI which is the value of this parameter.  The name
      will be used as the lvalue in the fetch response message.

   openid.ax.required The value of this parameter is an identifier name
      corresponding to a URI defined in an "openid.ax.fetch.<identifier
      name>".  The Identity Provider must provide the identity
      information specified in this parameter or return an error
      condition.

   openid.ax.if_available The value of this parameter is an identifier
      name corresponding to a URI defined in an
      "openid.ax.fetch.<identifier name>".  The Identity Provider may
      provide the identity information specified in this parameter.  Not
      including the information in the response does not constitute an
      error condition.

   This example requests the required full name information, and the
   optional favourite dog information.


   openid.ns.ax=http://openid.net/srv/ax/1.0
   openid.ax.fetch.fname=http://example.com/schema/fullname
   openid.ax.fetch.fav_dog=http://example.com/schema/favourite_dog
   openid.ax.required=fname
   openid.ax.if_available=fav_dog


4.2.  Fetch Response Format

   The fetch response message supplies the information requested in the
   fetch request in a format suitable for consumption by a standard HTML
   form processor.  Each attribute is supplied with the assigned
   identifier name as the lvalue and the attribute value as the rvalue.

   The response to the previous request example, in which the required
   full name information and the optional favourite dog information are
   both supplied.


   fname="John Smith"
   fav_dog="Spot"

5.  Store Message

   The store message is used to store personal identity information to
   the Identity Provider.

5.1.  Store Request Format

   All of the following request fields are OPTIONAL.  Any identifier
   name referred to in a "value" parameter MUST have an associated
   "openid.ax.label.<identifier name>" parameter.

   openid.ax.label.<identifier name> Associates an identifier name with
      the attribute URI which is the value of this parameter.  The name
      will be used as a reference in an "openid.ax.value.<identifier
      name>" parameter.

   openid.ax.value.<identifier name> Assigns a value to the identifier
      with the name assigned by a "label" parameter.



   openid.ns.ax=http://openid.net/srv/ax/1.0
   openid.ax.label.fname=http://example.com/schema/fullname
   openid.ax.value.fname="Bob Smith"


5.2.  Store Response Format

   The store response consists of an empty response message with the 200
   HTTP response code as per the OpenID specification [OpenID_Auth].
